        <h1>Week 7 Reading Notes</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 11 Further Functions</h2>
        <h3>Function Properties and Methods</h3>
        <p>all functions have a length property that returns the number of parameters the function has</p>
        <p>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument.</p>
        <p>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined.</p>
        <p>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself.</p>
        <p>This technique can be used with the feature detection that we discussed in the last chapter to create functions that rewrite themselves, known as <b>init-time branching</b>.</p>
        <p>Callbacks are functions passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to.</p>
        <p>Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming</p>
        <p>A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation.</p>
        <h2>Chapter 13 Ajax</h2>
        <p>Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client.</p>
        <p>The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch.</p>
        <p>The json() method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</p>
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>Is Ajax considered backend or frontend?</p>
        <p>Can Ajax be used without any other client-side language like JavaScript?</p>
