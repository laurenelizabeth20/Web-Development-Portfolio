        <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
        <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
        <p>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</p>
        <p>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</p>
        <p>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</p>
        <p>Exception: an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>
        <p>Stack trace: a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error ocurred.</p>
        <p>Warning: occurs when there is an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.</p>
        <p>Strict mode: produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.</p>
        <p>Not using strict mode is referred to as sloppy mode.</p>
        <p>Linting tools test the quality of JavaScript code.</p>
        <p>The alert method is the most basic form of debugging.</p>
        <p>Alert stops a program from running until OK is clicked.</p>
        <p>Use the console.log or console.trace to use the console to debug.</p>
        <p>Debugger keyword: creates a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code.</p>
        <p>Use the throw statement to throw your own exceptions.</p>
        <p>Test-driven development: the process of writing tests before any actual code.</p>
        <p>Jest: a testing framework that makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.</p>
        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>Is jest the most popular framework for JavaScript?</p>
        <p>What are some other frameworks for JavaScript and how do you choose which one to use?</p>
        <p>Is there ever a reason to not use strict mode other than laziness?</p>
