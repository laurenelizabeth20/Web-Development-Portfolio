        <h1>Week 4 Reading Notes</h1>
        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>Create a dice object:</p>
        <p>const Dice = function(sides=6){
                this.sides = sides;
                this.roll = function() {
                    return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
                }
            }  
        </p>
        <p>'this' is used to represent the object that will be returned by the constructor function.</p>
        <p>'sides' is a property of the dice object.</p>
        <p>'roll' is a method of the dice object.</p>
        <p>Instance of dice:</p>
        <p>const redDice = new Dice();</p>
        <p>'new' is an operator to create a new instance of an object. Parentheses after object name not required.</p>
        <p>Checking to see if redDice is an instance of Dice:</p>
        <p>redDice instanceof Dice</p>
        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <p>The form object has a method called elements. This form has two controls which are the input and button elements:</p>
        <p>const [input,button] = form.elements;</p>
        <p>Setting the action of a form:</p>
        <p>form.action = '/an/other.url'</p>
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>How public are public methods? Are they unsafe?</p>
        <p>What is a scenario where a static method is preferable to a regular method?</p>
